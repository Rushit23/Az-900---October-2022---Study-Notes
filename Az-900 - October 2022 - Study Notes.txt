- Azure ARc  allows you to manage virtual machines running in Azure, in your own environment, and in other environments such as AWS


-  Which storage redundancy option is the cheapest?


        - By default, Azure Storage replicates data three times within a primary region.
        - LRS is the lowest-cost redundancy option and offers the least durability compared to other options. LRS protects your data against server rack and drive failures.

        - Locally redundant storage (LRS)—synchronously replicates data to three disks within a data center in the primary region. Offers a moderate level of availability at a lower cost.

        Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)—synchronously replicates data amongthree Azure availability zones in the primary region. Provides a higher level of resilience at higher cost.Beyond these two basic types of replication, there are three additional types available in Azure Storage:

        Geo-Redundant storage (GRS)—stores another three copies of data in a paired Azure regionRead-Access Geo-Redundant

         (RA-GRS)—same as GRS, but allows data to be read from both Azure regionsObject Replication for Block Blob Storage—a special type of replication used only for block blobs, replicating them between a source and target storage account.

- Azure ARc - allows you to manage Windows and Linux machines running on-premesis or in other cloud providers, as if they were Azure VMs.

- Azure pairs each region with another region, to provide additional high-availability options for customers. You're not restricted to storing your backups in other regions, but if you choose to do so in the region paired to your main region you'll get some benefits.

   Region Pair is used to describe a relationship between two regions within the same geographic region for disaster recovery purposes.



- Azure availability zones are physically separate locations within each Azure region that are tolerant to local failures. Failures can range from software and hardware failures to events such as earthquakes, floods, and fires. Tolerance to failures is achieved because of redundancy and logical isolation of Azure services. To ensure resiliency, a minimum of three separate availability zones are present in all availability zone-enabled regions.

  Logical Isolation of Azure Services.


  Availability Zones - Unique physical locations within an Azure region, made up of one or more datacenters; there is a minimum of three zones in each region; you can manually place your resources in an availability zone for highest availability

- The public cloud is defined as computing services offered by third-party providers over the public Internet, making them available to anyone who
wants to use or purchase them.

- The private cloud is defined as computing services offered either over the Internet or a private internal network and only to select users instead of
the general public.Looks and acts like a cloud, except customer owns or leases or has exclusive access to the hardware

- A hybrid cloud… is a computing environment that combines a private cloud with a public cloud.”

**Cloud Models**

1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage, and networking resources on
   demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

     Examples : Virtual machines, networking, load balancers, firewalls


2. Platform as a service (PaaS) is a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud

  -  Like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure—servers, storage, and networking—but also middleware.
  -  PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building,testing, deploying, managing, and updating.
  -  development tools, business intelligence (BI) services, database management systems.
  -  Upload code packages and have them run, without access to the hardware

  - Even with PaaS, you have to choose an App Service Plan

  ** - With PaaS, scaling is your responsibility



3. Software as a service (SaaS) allows users to connect to and use cloud-based apps over the Internet. Common examples are
   email, calendaring, and office tools (such as Microsoft Office 365).

     - Access to configuration only


4. Serverless 

    - There are still servers… you just don’t ever have to deal with them, Even less access to the server than PaaS.
 
   - Serverless means not worrying about choosing the right plan, Scalling

   - means you might pay $0 if you don’t use the service

   - Compute - Azure Functions
   - Compute - Serverless Kubernetes (Virtual Nodes w/ ACI)
   - Database - Azure SQL Database Serverless
   - Database - Cosmos DB Serverless







- Azure Has 60+ Regions


    - Each region has one other region which is treated as it’s “pair”
    - Almost always in the same geography - data storage laws
    - The data connection between region pairs is thehighest speed available
    - Software rollouts are deployed to one region of a pairand the other is not touched
    - If multiple regions go down, one region of each pair is treated as a priority

    **Brazil Brazil South - South Central US [Brazil has one Region only Pairs with South Cental US]

    Soveregion Regions - Azure Government (US) , China  [AZ- china and AZ US Goverment Not Operated by Microsoft]
                       

    - 1 Azure Region has 3 Availability Zone






- Management Groups > Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources

- Subscription is a billing unit - Users have access to one or more subscriptions, with different roles.






 Azure compute Services 


        ● Virtual Machines (VM)
        ● VM Scale Sets (VMSS)

               - Microsoft Azure VM Scale Sets are groups of individual virtual machines (VMs) within the Microsoft Azure public cloud that information technology (IT) administrators can configure and manage as a single unit. Administrators can use Azure VM Scale Sets to deploy complete services, rather than duplicate the same VMs.

        ● App services (Web apps)

               - Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends.



        ● Azure Container Instances (ACI)

             - Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a managed service that allows you to run containers directly on the Microsoft Azure public cloud, without requiring the use of virtual machines (VMs).

             - Develop apps fast without managing virtual machines or having to learn new tools—it's just your application, in a container, running in the cloud.


             - Azure Container Service.PASS -  Azure Service Fabric which is offered as a Paas.



        ● Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)


             - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) offers the quickest way to start developing and deploying cloud-native apps, with built-in code-to-cloud pipelines and guardrails.
         
             - Kubernetes is neither IaaS nor PaaS.

        ● Windows Virtual Desktop

Azure Networking services 


       - Virtual Networks

             - Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. VNet enables many types of Azure resources, such as Azure Virtual Machines (VM), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.


             - A virtual network is a networking system that emulates a physical network by combining the hardware and software network resources to form a single administrative unit. A virtual switch (vSwitch) is a central component in virtual networks




       - VPN Gateway - VPN gateways provide secure connectivity between multiple sites.

                     - Azure VPN Gateway connects your on-premises networks to Azure through Site-to-Site VPNs in a similar way that you set up and connect to a remote branch office. The connectivity is secure and uses the industry-standard protocols Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) and Internet Key Exchange (IKE).



       - ExpressRoute


                   - ExpressRoute is a service that enables you to create private connections between Azure datacenters and infrastructure that's on your premises or in a colocation environment

                   - An ExpressRoute virtual network gateway helps to exchange IP routes between your Azure and on-premises networks and to route network traffic. To connect to virtual networks in Azure with ExpressRoute, you'll need to create a virtual network gateway.


                   - you do not require VPN because its Private itself.




      - VNet Peering

                     - Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. The traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure.

                     - VNet peering: Data replication, database failover, and other scenarios needing frequent backups of large data.

          Resource Locks      

                             - Using RBAC, you can restrict who has access to locks

                             - As an administrator, you can lock an Azure subscription, resource group, or resource to protect them from accidental user deletions and modifications. The lock overrides any user permissions. You can set locks that prevent either deletions or modifications. In the portal,

                             **  these locks are called Delete and Read-only.



          Service Trust Portal

                            
                            - Service Trust Portal is the repository Azure uses to expose / provide customers with Azure's compliance documentation, whitepapers, and reports.

- Paired regions are usually in the same geo (not always) but are the most logical place to store backups because they have a high speed connection and Azure staggers the service updates to those regions.




- ARM Templates - allows you to use JSON to define your infrastructure, and is sometimes described as <b>infrastructure as code</b>?

              To implement infrastructure as code for your Azure solutions, use Azure Resource Manager templates (ARM templates). The template is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that defines the infrastructure and configuration for your project. The template uses declarative syntax, which lets you state what you intend to deploy without having to write the sequence of programming commands to create it. In the template, you specify the resources to deploy and the properties for those resources.

      - SQL SERVER IN VM
      - Virtual Machine Scale sets


      ** Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule. Scale sets provide the following key benefits: Easy to create and manage multiple VMs.

      ** With Azure SQL Database, the infrastructure is not in your control.





- Having multiple subscriptions can technically be done for any reason, but it only makes sense if you have to separate billing directly, or have actual clients logging into the Portal to manage their resources.




- Application Gateway [Load Balancer + WEb application Firewall], Application Gateways also comes with an optional Web Application Firewall (or WAF) as a security benefit.


- Consumption-based pricing charges you based on the actual usage as opposed to a fixed monthly rate. If you reduce your usage, you instantly reduce your cost.


- Load Balancer or Application Gateway -  allows you to evenly split traffic coming in and direct it to several identical virtual machines to do the work and respond to the request.


- In Azure, resource tags are Metadata elements  that can be associated with each resource.


-  Total cost of ownership (TCO) 
   
     - Real Estate costs
     - Electricity costs
     - IT Operations Salaries


- Availability - what percentage of time does a system respond properly to requests, expressed as a percentage over time.


- Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform.


-  Powershell and CLI are the same.

- The Archive tier is an offline tier for storing data that is rarely accessed. The Archive access tier has the lowest storage cost, but higher data retrieval costs and latency compared to the Hot and Cool tiers.


- Budgets in Cost Management help you plan for and drive organizational accountability. They help you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs, and to monitor how spending progresses over time. You can configure alerts based on your actual cost or forecasted cost to ensure that your spend is within your organizational spend limit. When the budget thresholds you've created are exceeded, only notifications are triggered. None of your resources are affected and your consumption isn't stopped. You can use budgets to compare and track spending as you analyze costs.


- Azure Ingress bandwidth is free. You pay for egress (outbound).



- A resource group is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. The resource group can include all the resources for the solution, or only those resources that you want to manage as a group. You decide how you want to allocate resources to resource groups based on what makes the most sense for your organization. Generally, add resources that share the same lifecycle to the same resource group so you can easily deploy, update, and delete them as a group.



- Unmanaged storage account - There is a cost for egress (bandwidth out) and it's hard to estimate how many bytes will be counted leaving an Azure network


- All virtual machines must be associated with at least one virtual network subnet, using a network interface card.


- Using Power shell or CLI opposed to Azure Portal - The real benefit is automation. Being able to write a script to do something is better than having to do it manually each time.



- Windows servers use 'remote desktop protocol' (RDP) in order for administrators to get access to manage the server. Linux servers use SSH. What is the recommendation for ensuring the security of these protocols?

      - You need to either control access to the RDP and SSH ports to a very specific range of IPs, enable the ports only when you are using it, or use a Bastion server/jump box to protect those servers



- Azure App Service is PAAs - You give Azure the code and configuration, and you have no access to the underlying hardware.


- There is not a limit to the number of subscriptions a single user can be included on.


- Azure Policy can add restrictions on storage account SKUs, virtual machine instance types, and rules relating to tagging of resources and groups. It cannot prompt a user to ask them if they are sure.

- The three principles of zero trust are: verify explicitly, use least privilege access, and assume breach.


- The Microsoft Service Trust Portal provides a variety of content, tools, and other resources about Microsoft security, privacy, and compliance practices.

- Each Virtual Machine has a Resource Health blade.

- Network Security Group (NSG) - a fairly basic set of rules that you can apply to both inbound traffic and outbound traffic that lets you specify what sources, destinations and ports are allowed to travel through from outside the virtual network to inside the virtual network.


- Azure AD is the identity service designed for web protocols, that you can use for your applications.

-The Azure App Service Environment (ASE) is a Premium feature offering of the Azure App Service. It gives a single-tenant instance of the Azure App Service that runs right in your own Azure virtual network (VNet), providing network isolation and improved scaling capabilities

     - Azure App Service Environment (ASE) are isolated (single-tenant) environments where you can deploy one or more Azure App Services on your own virtual network.



- Maximum amount of Azure Storage space a single subscription can store?

    A single Azure subscription can have up to 250 storage accounts per region, and each storage account can store up to 5 Petabytes. That is 31 million Terabytes. This is probably 15-20 times what Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook use combined. That's a lot.


- Since you have full control over a virtual machine, you can run a containerized app on it, including installing Docker Desktop on that machine.


- IAAs - IaaS or Infrastructure as a service requires you to keep your OS patched, close ports, and generally protect your own server. requires the highest level of involvement in maintaining the operating system and file system by the customer.


- An Azure account can cost nothing if you don't use any resources or only use free resources 0$


- IAAS- Virtual Machine Scale Sets - these are a set of identical virtual machines (from 1 to 1000 instances) that are designed to auto-scale up and down based on user demand

      - and also provides load balancing services built in


- Azure availability zones are physically and logically separated datacenters with their own independent power source, network, and cooling.
 Connected with an extremely low-latency network, they become a building block to delivering high availability applications.



 - Azure Monitor - If you wanted to get an alert every time a new virtual machine is created.The best place to track events at the resource level is Azure Monitor.


 - Any Platform as service i.e [Azure App service] - Code + Configuration.


 - Azure Monitor allows you to monitor activity logs from Azure Active Directory.

    You can route Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) activity logs to several endpoints for long term retention and data insights. Using this feature, you can send Azure AD activity logs to Azure Monitor logs to enable rich visualizations, monitoring and alerting on the connected data.


- MFA :  KHA - Know , have , are 


- Deploying a virtual machine into an availability set,An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application is built to provide for redundancy and availability. Each virtual machine in your availability set is assigned an update domain and a fault domain by the underlying Azure platform. Fault domains define the group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch. By default, the virtual machines configured within your availability set are separated across up to three fault domains. While placing your virtual machines into an availability set does not protect your application from operating system or application-specific failures, it does limit the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.

- A network security group (NSG) - control the traffic flowing between two subnets on the same virtual network


A network security group (NSG) contains a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to subnets, NICs, or both. NSGs can be associated with either subnets or individual NICs connected to a subnet. When an NSG is associated with a subnet, the ACL rules apply to all the VMs in that subnet. Traffic to an individual NIC can be restricted by associating an NSG directly to a NIC.


-  The list of standards that Azure has been certified to meet is in the Trust Center- standards Microsoft is in compliance with.


- General purpose v2 is the standard storage account type for blobs, file shares, queues, and tables.- most common and recommended type of storage account?


- An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs Has update domain and a fault domain by the underlying Azure platform.

      - Fault domains define the group of virtual machines that share a common power source and network switch.

      - By default, the virtual machines configured within your availability set are separated across up to three fault domains. 

      - While placing your virtual machines into an availability set does not protect your application from operating system or application-specific failures, 

      - it does limit the impact of potential physical hardware failures, network outages, or power interruptions.




- Passwordless authentication provides a higher level of convenience over the password/MFA style of authentication. Security is similar between them. 



- Private cloud generally means that you are running your code on isolated computing, not mixed in with other companies

- Subscription is the level at which things get billed. Multiple users can be associated with a subscription at various permission levels.




- AD Connect is used to synchronize your corporate AD with Azure AD.

- The region is the area of the world where resources get created. You can create resources in any region that you have access to. But there are sometimes restrictions when creating a resource in one region that related resources like networks must also be in the same region for logical reasons.


- Yes, Azure Tenant is a dedicated and trusted instance of Azure AD that's automatically created when your organization signs up for a Microsoft cloud service subscription.

- concept of being able to get your applications and data running in another environment quickly (BC/DR)


- Azure DDos Protection Basic is free, while you can upgrade to Standard for a fee. [Basic + standard]




- Azure Functions - Functions are designed for short pieces of code that start and end quickly.

- Each person has their own user id and password to log into Azure. But how many subscriptions can a single account be associated with

    No limit - There is not a limit to the number of subscriptions a single user can be included on.


- There is 1 region in Brazil.

- There is no benefit, only a matter of personal choice > Powershell over CLI

- Application Gateways also comes with an optional Web Application Firewall (or WAF) as a security benefit + Load Balancer

- Big Data - a set of open source (Apache Hadoop) products that can do analysis on millions and billions of rows of data; current tools like SQL Server are not good for this scale.


- An Azure account can cost nothing if you don't use any resources or only use free resources


- IaaS or Infrastructure as a service requires you to keep your OS patched, close ports, and generally protect your own server - requires the highest level of involvement in maintaining the operating system and file system by the customer


- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) - this is the common resource deployment model that underlies all resource creation or modification; no matter whether you use the portal, powershell or the SDK, the Azure Resource Manager takes those commands and executes them

- A single Azure subscription can have up to 250 storage accounts per region, and each storage account can store up to 5 Petabytes. That is 31 million Terabytes. This is probably 15-20 times what Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook use combined. That's a lot.


- Load Balancer + Application gateway - enly split traffic coming in and direct it to several identical virtual machines to do the work and respond to the request


- PAAS -You give Azure the code and configuration, and you have no access to the underlying hardware


- ISO is a standards body, International Organization for Standardization

- What Is CapEx?

CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure upfront and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time and usually has no recurring cost. Deploying your own data center and Azure Reserved VM Instances are a few examples of the CapEx pricing model.


Capital expenditures generate benefits over a long period. These expenditures are generally nonrecurring and result in the acquisition of permanent assets. Building an application could qualify as a capital expenditure. Example, Azure Reserved Instances (Azure RI) help Azure’s most active customers save on long-term VM usage reserving VMs in advance at a discounted price by committing to a one or three-year benefits.


What Is OpEx?
OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There’s no upfront cost but has a recurring cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it i.e. pay-as-you-go pricing.


Operating expenditures are ongoing costs of doing business. Consuming cloud services in a pay-as-you-go model could qualify as an operating expenditure. Example, you pay for a service or product as you use it i.e. pay-as-you-go pricing.
